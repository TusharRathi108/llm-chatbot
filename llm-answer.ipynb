BIRTH AND PARENTAGE \\nThe Gandhis belong to the Bania caste and seem to have been originally \\ngrocers. But for three generations, from my grandfather, they have been Prime \\nMinisters in several Kathiawad States. Uttamchand Gandhi, alias Ota Gandhi, \\nmy grandfather, must have been a man of principle. State intrigues compelled \\nhim to leave Porbandar, where he was Diwan, and to seek refuge in Junagadh. \\nThere he saluted the Nawab with the left hand. Someone, noticing the \\napparent discourtesy, asked for an explanation, which was given thus: ‘The \\nright hand is already pledged to Porbandar.’ \\nOta Gandhi married a second time, having lost his first wife. He had four sons \\nby his first wife and two by his second wife. I do not think that in my childhood \\nI'\n",
      " 'ever felt or knew that these sons of Ota Gandhi were not all of the same \\nmother. The fifth of these six brothers was Karamchand Gandhi, alias Kaba \\nGandhi, and the sixth was Tulsidas Gandhi. Both these brothers were Prime \\nMinisters in Porbandar, one after the other. Kaba Gandhi was my father. He \\nwas a member of the Rajasthanik Court. It is now extinct, but in those days it \\nwas a very influential body for settling disputes between the chiefs and their \\nfellow clansmen. He was for some time Prime Minister in Rajkot and then in \\nVankaner. He was a pensioner of the Rajkot State when he died. \\nKaba Gandhi married four times in succession, having lost his wife each time by \\ndeath. He had two daughters by his first and second marriages. His last wife, \\nPutlibai, bore him a daughter and three sons, I being the youngest. \\nMy father was a lover of his clan, truthful, brave and generous, but short-\\ntempered. To a certain extent he might have been even given to carnal \\npleasures. For he marrie'\n",
      " 'd for the fourth time when he was over forty. But he \\nwas incorruptible and had earned a name for strict impartiality in his family as \\nwell as outside. His loyalty to the State was well known. An Assistant Political \\nAgent spoke insultingly of the Rajkot Thakore Saheb, his chief, and he stood up \\nto the insult. The Agent was angry and asked Kaba Gandhi to apologize. This he \\nAn Autobiography or My Experiments with Truth \\n \\nwww.mkgandhi.org  \\nPage 23 \\nrefused to do and was therefore kept under detention for a few hours. But \\nwhen the Agent saw that Kaba Gandhi was adamant, he ordered him to be \\nreleased. \\nMy father never had any ambition to accumulate riches and left us very little \\nproperty. \\nHe had no education, save that of experience. At best, he might be said to \\nhave read up to the fifth Gujarati standard. Of history and geography he was \\ninnocent. But his rich experience of practical affairs stood him in good stead in \\nthe solution of the most intricate questions and in managing'\n",
      " ...\n",
      " 'ght is only the faintest glimmer of that mighty effulgence. But this \\nmuch I can say with assurance, as a result of all my experiments, that a perfect \\nvision of Truth can only follow a complete realization of Ahimsa. \\nTo see the universal and all-pervading Spirit of Truth face to face one must be \\nable to love the meanest of creation as oneself. And a man who aspires after \\nthat cannot afford to keep out of any field of life. That is why my devotion to \\nTruth has drawn me into the field of politics; and I can say without the \\nslightest hesitation, and yet in all humility, that those who say that religion has \\nnothing to do with politics do not know what religion means. \\nIdentification with everything that lives is impossible without self-purification; \\nwithout self-purification the observance of the law of Ahimsa must remain an \\nempty dream; God can never be realized by one who is not pure of heart. Self-\\npurification therefore must mean purification in all the walks of life. And \\npur'\n",
      " \"ification being highly infectious, purification of oneself necessarily leads to \\nthe purification of one's surroundings. \\nBut the path of self-purification is hard and steep. To attain to perfect purity \\none has to become absolutely passion-free in thought, speech and action; to \\nrise above the opposing currents of love and hatred, attachment and repulsion. \\nI know that I have not in me as yet that triple purity, in spite of constant \\nceaseless striving for it. That is why the world's praise fails to move me, indeed \\nit very often stings me. To conquer the subtle passions seems to me to be \\nharder far than the physical conquest of the world by the force of arms. Ever \\nsince my return to India I have had experience of the dormant passions lying \\nhidden within me. The knowledge of them has made me feel humiliated though \\nnot defeated. The experiences and experiments have sustained me and given \\nme great joy. But I know that I have still before me a difficult path to traverse. \\nAn Autobio\"\n",
      " 'graphy or My Experiments with Truth \\n \\nwww.mkgandhi.org  \\nPage 556 \\nI must reduce myself to zero. So long as a man does not of his own free will put \\nhimself last among his fellow creatures, there is no salvation for him. Ahimsa is \\nthe farthest limit of humility. \\nIn bidding farewell to the reader, for the time being at any rate, I ask him to \\njoin with me in prayer to the God of Truth that He may grant me the boon \\nof Ahimsa in mind, word and deed.']\n"
