| seem to have been originally grocers. But for three generations, from my     |
| grandfather, they have been Prime Ministers in several Kathiawad States.     |
| Uttamchand Gandhi, alias Ota Gandhi, my grandfather, must have been a man of |
| principle. State intrigues compelled him to leave Porbandar, where he was    |
| Diwan, and to seek refuge in Junagadh. There he saluted the Nawab with the   |
| left hand. Someone, noticing the apparent discourtesy, asked for an          |
| explanation, which was given thus : ‘The right hand is already pledged to    |
| Porbandar. ’ Ota Gandhi married a second time, having lost his first wife.   |
| He had four sons by his first wife and two by his second wife. I do not      |
| think that in my childhood I ever felt or knew that these sons of Ota Gandhi |
| were not all of the same mother. The fifth of these six brothers was         |
| Karamchand Gandhi, alias Kaba Gandhi, and the sixth was Tulsidas Gandhi.     |
| Both these brothers were Prime Ministers in Porbandar, one after the other.  |
| Kaba Gandhi was my father. He was a member of the Rajasthanik Court. It is   |
| now extinct, but in those days it was a very influential body for settling   |
| disputes between the chiefs and their fellow clansmen. He was for some time  |
| Prime Minister in Rajkot and then in Vankaner. He was a pensioner of the     |
| Rajkot State when he died. Kaba Gandhi married four times in succession,     |
| having lost his wife each time by death. He had two daughters by his first   |
| and second marriages. His last wife, Putlibai, bore him a daughter and three |
| sons, I being the youngest. My father was a lover of his clan, truthful,     |
| brave and generous, but short- tempered. To a certain extent he might have   |
| been even given to carnal pleasures. For he married for the fourth time when |
| he was over forty. But he was incorruptible and had earned a name for strict |
| impartiality in his family as well as outside. His loyalty to the State was  |
| well known. An Assistant Political Agent spoke insultingly of the Rajkot     |
| Thakore Saheb, his chief, and he stood up to the insult. The Agent was angry |
| and asked Kaba Gandhi to apologize. This he (Similarity: 0.6520)  2. [Page   |

| 531 operation with Government. It is an inalienable right of the people thus |
| to withhold co-operation. We are not bound to retain Government titles and   |
| honours, or to continue in Government service. If Government should betray   |
| us in a great cause like the Khilafat, we could not do otherwise than non-   |
| co- operate. We are therefore entitled to non- co-operate with Government in |
| case of a betrayal.' But months elapsed before the word non- co-operation    |
| became a current coin. For the time being it was lost in the proceedings of  |
| the conference. Indeed when I supported the co-operation resolution at the   |
| Congress which met at Amritsar a month later, I did so in the hope that the  |
| betrayal would never come. (Similarity: 0.6399)  3. [Page 554] An            |
| Autobiography or My Experiments with Truth www.mkgandhi.org  Page 553 The    |
| question of the goal of the Congress formed a subject for keen discussion.   |
| In the constitution that I had presented, the goal of the Congress was the   |
| attainment of Swaraj within the British Empire if possible and without if    |
| necessary. A party in the Congress wanted to limit the goal to Swaraj within |
| the British Empire only. Its view-point was put forth by Pandit Malaviyaji   |
| and Mr. Jinnah. But they were not able to get many votes. Again the draft    |
| constitution provided that the means for the attainment were to be peaceful  |
| and legitimate. This condition too came in for opposition, it being          |
| contended that there should be no restriction upon the means to be adopted.  |
| But the Congress adopted the original draft after an instructive and frank   |
| discussion. I am of opinion that, if this constitution had been worked out   |
| by the people honestly, intelligently and zealously, it would have become a  |
| potent instrument of mass education, and the very process of working it out  |
| would have brought us Swaraj. But a discussion of the theme would be         |
| irrelevant here. Resolutions about Hindu-Muslim unity, the removal of        |
| untouchability and Khadi too were passed in this Congress, and since then    |
| the Hindu members of the Congress have taken upon themselves the             |
| responsibility of ridding Hinduism of the curse of untouchability, and the   |
| Congress has established a living bond of relationship with the 'skeletons'  |
| of India through Khadi. The adoption of non- co-operation for the sake of    |
| the Khilafat was itself a great practical attempt made by the Congress to    |
| bring about Hindu-Muslim unity. (Similarity: 0.6352)  4. [Page 5] An         |
| Autobiography or My Experiments with Truth www.mkgandhi.org  Page 4 which    |
| made Gandhiji an uncompromising crusader against racialism and colonialism.  |
| He gave us an unfailing ‘talisman’ for right action: “Whenever you are in    |
| doubt, or when the self becomes too much with you, apply the following test: |
| Recall the face of the poorest and the weakest man whom you may have seen,   |
| and ask yourself if the step you contemplate is going to be of any use to    |
| him…. Then you will find your doubts and self melting away.”  9 Gandhiji was |
| a firm believer in the democratic way of life. He maintained that true       |
| democracy could be evolved only through non-violence and spontaneous         |
| cooperation. “The spir it of democracy cannot be imposed from without; it    |
| has to come from within.” 10 He envisioned a ‘world federation’ raised on    |
| the foundations of integrity and mutual respect in international affairs.    |
| While he laboured ceaselessly for India’s freedom and rena issance, he was   |
| averse to ‘isolated independence’. He wanted each nation to imbibe the good  |
| qualities of others, without losing her own soul or genius. To quote his own |
| classical expression, “I do not want my house to be walled in or all sides   |
| and my windows to be stuffed; I want the cultures of all the lands to be     |
| blown about my house as freely as possible; but I refuse to be blown off my  |
| feet by any.” 11 It is, therefore, quite appropriate that we should suitably |
| celebrate the birth centenary of one who had lived every minute of his life  |
| for the good of mankind, and had highlighted some basic prinicples as guide  |
| lines for humanity. In the inimitable words of Pandit Nehru, “the light that |
| has illumined this country for these many years, will illumine this country  |
| for many more years, and a thousand years later, that light will still be    |
| seen in this country and the world will see it, and it will give solace to   |
| innumerable hearts.” “For, that light represented something more than the    |
| immediate present; it represented the living, eternal truths, reminding us   |
| of the right path, drawing us from the error.” 12 And as Dr. Albert Einstein |
| had feelingly observed, “generations to come, it may be, will scarce believe |
| that such a one as this ever, in flesh and blood, walked upon this earth.”   |
| As a part of the Gandhi Centenary celebrations, the Navajivan Trust, which   |
| was founded by Mahatma Gandhi himself half a century ago, has decided to     |
| publish (Similarity: 0.6338)  5. [Page 291] An Autobiography or My           |
| Experiments with Truth www.mkgandhi.org  Page 290 had no responsible         |
| government, there being a foreign power governing them. In South Africa the  |
| Europeans were settled emigrants. They had become South African citizens and |
| had control over the departmental officers. But the autocrats from Asia now  |
| appeared on the scene, and the Indians in consequence found themselves       |
| between the devil and the deep sea. I had a fair taste of this autocracy. I  |
| was first summoned to see the chief of the department, an officer from       |
| Ceylon. Lest I should appear to exaggerate when I say that I was 'summoned'  |
| to see the chief, I shall make myself clear. No written order was sent to    |
| me. Indian leaders often had to visit the Asiatic officers. Among these was  |
| the late Sheth Tyeb Haji Khanmahomed. The chief of the office asked him who  |
| I was and why I had come there. 'He is our adviser,' said Tyeb Sheth, 'and   |
| he has come here at our request.' 'Then what are we here for? Have we not    |
| been appointed to protect you? What can Gandhi know of the conditions here?' |
| asked the autocrat. Tyeb Sheth answered the charge as best he could: 'Of     |
| course you are there. But Gandhi is our man. He knows our language and       |
| understands us. You are after all officials.' The Sahib ordered Tyeb Sheth   |
| to fetch me before him. I went to the Sahib in company with Tyeb Sheth and   |
| others. No seats were offered, we were all kept standing. 'What brings you   |
| here?' said the Sahib addressing me. 'I have come here at the request of my  |
| fellow countrymen to help them with my advice,' I replied. 'But don't you    |
| know that you have no right to come here? The permit you hold was given you  |
| by mistake.  You cannot be regarded as a domiciled Indian. You must go back. |
| You shall not wait on Mr. Chamberlain. It is for the protection of the       |
| Indians here that the Asiatic Department has been especially created. Well,  |
| you may go.' With this he bade me goodbye, giving me no opportunity for a    |
| reply. (Similarity: 0.6288)  6. [Page 175] An Autobiography or My            |
| Experiments with Truth www.mkgandhi.org  Page 174 name can then be struck    |
| off the roll, if he is proved guilty. The law makes no distinction between   |
| white and coloured people. The Court has therefore no authority to prevent   |
| Mr. Gandhi from being enrolled as an advocate. We admit his application. Mr. |
| Gandhi, you can now take the oath.' I stood up and took the oath before the  |
| Registar. As soon as I was sworn in, the Chief Justice, addressing me, said: |
| 'You must now take off your turban, Mr. Gandhi. You must submit to the rules |
| of the Court with regard to the dress to be worn by practising barristers.'  |
| I saw my limitations. The turban that I had insisted on wearing in the       |
| District Magistrate's Court I took off in obedience to the order of the      |
| Supreme Court. Not that, if I had resisted the order, the resistance could   |
| not have been justified. But I wanted to reserve my strength for fighting    |
| bigger battles. I should not exhaust my skill as a fighter in insisting on   |
| retaining my turban. It was worthy of a better cause. Sheth Abdulla and      |
| other friends did not like my submission (or was it weakness?). They felt    |
| that I should have stood by my right to wear the turban while practising in  |
| the Court. I tried to reason with them. I tried to press home to them the    |
| truth of the maxim, 'When at Rome do as the Romans do.' 'It would be right', |
| I said, 'to refuse to obey, if in India an English officer or judge ordered  |
| you to take off your turban; but as an officer of the  Court, it would have  |
| ill become me to disregard a custom of the Court in the province of Natal.'  |
| I pacified the friends somewhat with these and similar arguments, but I do   |
| not think I convinced them completely, in this instance, of the              |
| applicability of the principle of looking at a thing from a different        |
| standpoint in different circumstances. But all my life through, the very     |
| insistence on truth has taught me to appreciate the beauty of compromise. I  |
| saw in later life that this spirit was an essential part of Satyagraha. It   |
| has often meant endangering my life and incurring the displeasure of         |
| friends. But truth is hard as adamant and tender as a blossom. (Similarity:  |

| www.mkgandhi.org  Page 537 Sikhs mingled their blood. The three communities, |
| instead of being bound in a bond of amity and love, are, to all appearance,  |
| at war with one another, and the nation is at a loss as to how to utilize    |
| the memorial fund. My other aptitude which the Congress could utilize was as |
| a draftsman. The Congress leaders had found that I had a faculty for         |
| condensed expression, which I had acquired by long practice. The then        |
| existing constitution of the Congress was Gokhale's legacy. He had framed a  |
| few rules which served as a basis for running the Congress machinery. The    |
| interesting history of the framing of these rules I had learnt form          |
| Gokhale's own lips. But everybody had now come to feel that these rules were |
| no longer adequate for the ever increasing business of the Congress. The     |
| question had been coming up year after year. The Congress at that time had   |
| practically no machinery functioning during the interval between session and |
| session, or for dealing with fresh contingencies that might arise in the     |
| course of the year. The existing rules provided for three secretaries, but   |
| as a matter of fact only one of them was a functioning secretary, and even   |
| he was not a whole-timer. How was he, single-handed, to run the Congress     |
| office, to think of the future, or to discharge during the current year the  |
| obligations contracted by the Congress in the past? During that year,        |
| therefore, everybody felt that this question would assume all the more       |
| importance. The Congress was too unwieldy a body for the discussion of       |
| public affairs. There was no limit set to the number of delegates in the     |
| Congress or to the number of delegates that each province could return. Some |
| improvement upon the existing chaotic condition was thus felt by everybody   |
| to be an imperative necessity. I undertook the responsibility of framing a   |
| constitution on one condition. I saw that there were two leaders, viz., the  |
| Lokamanya and the Deshabandhu who had the greatest hold on the public. I     |
| requested that they, as the representatives of the people, should be         |
| associated with me on the Committee for framing the constitution. But since  |
| it was obvious that they would not have the time personally to participate   |
| in the constitution-making work, I suggested that two persons enjoying their |
| confidence should be appointed along with me on the Constitution Committee,  |
| and that the number of its personnel should be limited to three. This        |
| suggestion was accepted by the (Similarity: 0.6194)  8. [Page 535] An        |
| Autobiography or My Experiments with Truth www.mkgandhi.org  Page 534 But my |
| suggestion found no favour with these two seniors. The news of my proposal   |
| was somehow whispered to Lala Harkishanlal. 'This will never do. It will     |
| very much hurt the feelings of the Punjabis,' he said. I discussed the       |
| matter with Lokamanya, Deshabandhu and Mr. Jinnah, but no way out could be   |
| found. Finally I laid bare my distress to Malaviyaji. 'I see no prospect of  |
| a compromise,' I told him, 'and if I am to move my resolution, a division    |
| will have to be called and votes taken. But I do not find here any           |
| arrangements for it. The practice in the open session of the Congress so far |
| has been to take votes by a show of hands with the result that all           |
| distinction between visitors and delegates is lost, while, as for taking a   |
| count of votes in such vast assemblies, we have no means at all. So it comes |
| to this that, even if I want to call a division, there will be no facility   |
| for it, nor meaning in it.' But Lala Harkishanlal came to the rescue and     |
| undertook to make the necessary arrangements. 'We will not,' he said,        |
| 'permit visitors in the Congress pandal on the day on which voting is to     |
| take place. And as for taking the count, well, I shall see to that. But you  |
| must not absent yourself from the Congress.' I capitulated; I framed my      |
| resolution, and in heart trembling undertook to move it. Pandit Malaviyaji   |
| and Mr. Jinnah were to support it. I could notice that, although our         |
| difference of opinion was free from any trace of bitterness, and although    |
| our speeches too contained nothing but cold reasoning, the people could not  |
| stand the very fact of a difference; it pained them. They wanted unanimity.  |
| Even while speeches were being delivered, efforts to settle the difference   |
| were being made on the platform, and notes were being freely exchanged among |
| the leaders for that purpose. Malaviyaji was leaving no stone unturned to    |
| bridge the gulf. Just then Jeramdas handed over his amendment to me and      |
| pleaded in his own sweet manner to save the delegates from the dilemma of a  |
| division. His amendment appealed to me. Malaviyaji's eye was already         |
| scanning every quarter for a ray of hope. I told him that Jeramdas's         |
| amendment seemed to me to be likely to be acceptable to both the parties.    |
| The Lokamanya, to whom it was next shown, said, 'If C.R. Das approves, I     |
| will have no objection.' Deshabandhu at last thawed, and cast a look towards |
| Sjt. Bepin Chandra Pal for endorsement. Malaviyaji was filled with hope. He  |
| snatched away the slip of (Similarity: 0.6186)  9. [Page 4] An Autobiography |
| or My Experiments with Truth www.mkgandhi.org  Page 3 Alone’ stated, “there  |
| is evidently a hunger in the world for governments which are activated by    |
| moral principles, which take decisions not because they are expedient, but   |
| because they are right.” 5 There is an erroneous notion that Gandhiji was    |
| against the use of modern science and technology and favoured out-dated      |
| technniques for some spiritual or sentimental reasons. “I would price every  |
| invention made for the benefit of all,” remarked Gandhiji. “Mechanisation is |
| good when the hands are too few for the work intended to be accomplished. It |
| is an evil when there are more hands than required for the w ork, as is the  |
| case in India.”  6 Gandhiji was, thus, not against machinery as such, but    |
| objected to the ‘craze’ for machinery and its ‘indiscriminate                |
| multiplication’. In place of ‘mass production’ he advocated a system of      |
| ‘production by the masses’. He cle arly envisaged that in a developing       |
| country like India, with scarce capital and abundant labour, the physical    |
| energies of the masses could be converted into a vast constructive force     |
| under a democratic frame-work, which Professor Mumford, in a somewhat        |
| different context, terms a ‘megamachine’. 7 We have to realize without       |
| equivocation that the pursuit of material prosperity alone would land us     |
| into a blind alley. The modern industrial organisation has given birth to a  |
| few giant business corporations which tend to reduce the State to a          |
| subservient position and bind it to, what Professor Galbraith calls, a       |
| Techno-structure, consisting of specialists, planners and technicians. In    |
| order to avoid the perils of such an industrial system, the American         |
| economist recommends the strong assertion of ‘other goals’, so that the new  |
| Industrial State would become “responsive to the larger purpose s of the     |
| society”.8  These ‘goals’ could, doubtless, be essentially human and         |
| spiritual in accordance with Gandhiji’s ideals and programmes. Mahatma       |
| Gandhi was deeply concerned with the welfare of the ‘unprivileged’ classes   |
| in India as well as in other countries. While striving to promote the good   |
| of all in a Sarvodayal society, he directed his first care and attention to  |
| the needs of the poorest and the lowliest. Ruskin’s maxim of Unto This Last  |
| was a source of deep inspiration for his life and work. It was this human    |
| approach (Similarity: 0.6183)  10. [Page 426] An Autobiography or My         |
| Experiments with Truth www.mkgandhi.org  Page 425 amenities denied to the    |
| poor and, instead of taking avoidable hardships, discourtesies and injustice |
| as a matter of course, fight for their removal. Wherever I went in Kathiawad |
| I heard complaints about the Viramgam customs hardships. I therefore decided |
| immediately to make use of Lord Willingdon's offer. I collected and read all |
| the literature available on the subject, convinced myself that the           |
| complaints were well founded, and opened correspondence with the Bombay      |
| Government. I called on the Private Secretary to Lord Willingdon and waited  |
| on His Excellency also. The latter expressed his sympathy but shifted the    |
| blame on Delhi. 'If it had been in our hands, we should have removed the     |
| cordon long ago. You should approach the Government of India,' said the      |
| Secretary. I communicated with the Government of India, but got no reply     |
| beyond an acknowledgment. It was only when I had an occasion to meet Lord    |
| Chelmsford later that redress could be had. When I placed the facts before   |
| him, he expressed his astonishment. He had known nothing of the matter. He   |
| gave me a patient hearing, telephoned that very moment for papers about      |
| Viramgam, and promised to remove the cordon if the authorities had no        |
| explanation or defence to offer. Within a few days of this interview I read  |
| in the papers that the Viramgam customs cordon had been removed. I regarded  |
| this event as the advent of Satyagraha in India. For during my interview     |
| with the Bombay Government the Secretary had expressed his disapproval of a  |
| reference to Satyagraha in a speech which I had delivered in Bagasra (in     |
| Kathiawad). 'Is not this a threat?' he had asked. 'And do you think a        |
| powerful Government will yield to threats?' 'This was no threat,' I had      |
| replied. 'It was educating the people. It is my duty to place before the     |
| people all the legitimate remedies for grievances. A nation that wants to    |
| come into its own ought to know all the ways and means to freedom. Usually   |
| they include violence as the last remedy. Satyagraha, on the other hand, is  |
