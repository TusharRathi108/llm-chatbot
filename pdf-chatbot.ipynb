      "| of Mahatma Gandhi who is now universally recognised as the glorious symbol of truth and non-     |\n",
      "| violence. Gandhiji was not only a great national leader who liberated India from foreign         |\n",
      "| domination through a peaceful and bloodless struggle, but also a profound thinker who placed     |\n",
      "| before the world certain eternal principles for the guidance of human relationship and           |\n",
      "| international behaviour. He laid the greatest stress on the purity of the means for the          |\n",
      "| achievement of noble ends. “The means may be likened to a seed, the end to a tree; and there is  |\n",
      "| just the same inviolable connection between the means and the end as there is between the seed   |\n",
      "| and the tree.” 1 The Mahatma never compromised his adherence to this ideal even for the          |\n",
      "| attainment of Swaraj for India. He was convinced beyond any shadow of doubt that this method of  |\n",
      "| righteousness was, “ultimately, the shortest, although it may appear to be long, perhaps too     |\n",
      "| long.” 2 To Gandhiji, civilization, in the real sense of the term, consisted “not in the         |\n",
      "| multiplication, but in the deliberate and voluntary restriction of wants.”  3 He always upheld   |\n",
      "| the sublime aim of “simple living and high thinking”.  While he strained every nerve to provide  |\n",
      "| gainful employment to the hungry millions of India through various constructive activities, he   |\n",
      "| underscored the imperative need for raising the ‘standard of life’ of the people, including the  |\n",
      "| ethical and moral aspects. To him mere affluence and accumulation of material wealth was ‘a      |\n",
      "| primrose path’ leading to social, economic and cultural disintegration. “True economics,”        |\n",
      "| affirmed Gandhiji, “never militates against the highest ethical standard.” “An economics that    |\n",
      "| inculcates Mammon worship, and enables the strong to amass wealth at the expense of the weak, is |\n",
      "| a false and dismal science.” 4 At a time when a number of developed countries are faced with     |\n",
      "| this ‘tragedy of mere affluence’ it would be worth our while recollec ting Mahatma Gandhi’s      |\n",
      "| insistence on higher values for the establishment of a new world order. As a recent editorial in |\n",

      "| www.mkgandhi.org  Page 4 which made Gandhiji an uncompromising crusader against racialism and    |\n",
      "| colonialism. He gave us an unfailing ‘talisman’ for right action: “Whenever you are in doubt, or |\n",
      "| when the self becomes too much with you, apply the following test: Recall the face of the        |\n",
      "| poorest and the weakest man whom you may have seen, and ask yourself if the step you contemplate |\n",
      "| is going to be of any use to him…. Then you will find your doubts and self melting away.”  9     |\n",
      "| Gandhiji was a firm believer in the democratic way of life. He maintained that true democracy    |\n",
      "| could be evolved only through non-violence and spontaneous cooperation. “The spir it of          |\n",
      "| democracy cannot be imposed from without; it has to come from within.” 10 He envisioned a ‘world |\n",
      "| federation’ raised on the foundations of integrity and mutual respect in international affairs.  |\n",
      "| While he laboured ceaselessly for India’s freedom and rena issance, he was averse to ‘isolated   |\n",
      "| independence’. He wanted each nation to imbibe the good qualities of others, without losing her  |\n",
      "| own soul or genius. To quote his own classical expression, “I do not want my house to be walled  |\n",
      "| in or all sides and my windows to be stuffed; I want the cultures of all the lands to be blown   |\n",
      "| about my house as freely as possible; but I refuse to be blown off my feet by any.” 11 It is,    |\n",
      "| therefore, quite appropriate that we should suitably celebrate the birth centenary of one who    |\n",
      "| had lived every minute of his life for the good of mankind, and had highlighted some basic       |\n",
      "| prinicples as guide lines for humanity. In the inimitable words of Pandit Nehru, “the light that |\n",

      "| and a thousand years later, that light will still be seen in this country and the world will see |\n",

      "| than the immediate present; it represented the living, eternal truths, reminding us of the right |\n",

      "| STORM This was my first voyage with my wife and children. I have often observed in the course of |\n",
      "| this narrative that, on account of child marriages amongst middle-class Hindus, the husband will |\n",
      "| be literate whilst the wife remains practically unlettered. A wide gulf thus separates them, and |\n",
      "| the husband has to become his wife's teacher. So I had to think out the details of the dress to  |\n",
      "| be adopted by my wife and children, the food they were to eat, and the manners which would be    |\n",
      "| suited to their new surroundings. Some of the recollections of those days are amusing to look    |\n",
      "| back upon. A Hindu wife regards implicit obedience to her husband as the highest religion. A     |\n",
      "| Hindu husband regards himself as lord and master of his wife who must ever dance attendance upon |\n",
      "| him. I believed, at the time of which I am writing, that in order to look civilized, our dress   |\n",
      "| and manners had as far as possible to approximate to the European standard. Because, I thought,  |\n",
      "| only thus could we have some influence, and without influence it would not be possible to serve  |\n",
      "| the community. I therefore determined the style of dress for my wife and children. How could I   |\n",
      "| like them to be known as Kathiawad Banias? The Parsis used then to be regarded as the most       |\n",
      "| civilized people amongst Indians, and so, when the complete European style seemed to be          |\n",
      "| unsuited, we adopted the Parsi style. Accordingly my wife wore the Parsi sari, and the boys the  |\n",
      "| Parsi coat and trousers. Of course no one could be without shoes and stockings. It was long      |\n",
      "| before my wife and children could get used to them. The shoes cramped their feet and the         |\n",
      "| stockings stank with perspiration. The toes often got sore. I always had my answers ready to all |\n",
      "| these objections. But I have an impression that it was not so much the answers as the force of   |\n",
      "| authority that carried conviction. They agreed to the changes in dress as there was no           |\n",
